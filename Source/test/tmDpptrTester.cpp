/*
This program illustrates usage of the two reference classes tmDpptr<T> and
tmDpptrArray<T>.

A tmDpptr<T> is essentially a dangle-proof pointer-to-T; it behaves like a T*
and can be used anywhere you would normally use a T*, with one enhancement;
when the object of a tmDpptr<T> is deleted, the tmDpptr<T> sets itself to NULL.
Any subsequent attempt to dereference the pointer generates an exception.

A tmDpptrArray<T> acts like a tmArray<T*> (which is basically a vector<T*>),
but when any of the pointed-to objects are deleted, the pointer is completely
removed from the list.

You can give your own container classes the capability to interact with RefObjs
by descending them from the tmDpptrSrc class and overriding the appropriate
access member functions. See the implementation of tmDpptr and tmDpptrArray for
examples of how to do this.
